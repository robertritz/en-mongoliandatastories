### The Blog

Mongolian Data Stories was started in 2018 to tell “the hidden side” of Mongolia through data. The blog covers everything from air pollution to Tsagaan Sar debt, and there are always new topics being explored.

Originally this blog was hosted on Medium, but in 2021 the blog found a new home on Github pages. The new site opens up a lot of flexibility to now also host translated articles, embed more sophisticated visualizations, and hopefully become a place you want to come to read about Mongolia.

### Notebooks

Transparency and reproducibility are key values for this blog. As such, you can find all of the code, notebooks, and data for all the posts on the site on the Mongolian Data Stories [Github Repository](https://github.com/robertritz/mongoliandatastories/tree/main/notebooks).

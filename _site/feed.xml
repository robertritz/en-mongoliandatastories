&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR&lt;/strong&gt; Mongolia auctions off a “lucky number” license plate and the bids reach 427.45 million MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) in &lt;strong&gt;less than three hours&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s $150,035.10 USD at current exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers mean a lot to most Mongolians. Generally, 1, 3, 8, and 9 are considered “lucky” numbers. Mongolian phone numbers have 8 digits, and the first 4 of these numbers can tell you a lot about who is calling you. So-called “lucky” phone numbers beginning with 99 or 88 regularly sell for anywhere from $1,000 (9999-XXXX) up to $20,000 or more for the most elite (9911-XXXX). These phone numbers are sold on the “secondary market” from person to person. If a 9911-XXXX number calls you and you don’t answer, expect them to be upset…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, license plate numbers are assigned to a vehicle and can’t be transferred between individuals. In addition, up until recently, you couldn’t pay for a better license plate number. This caused a situation where the “best” license plates (think 0001-УБА) &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; ended up on Mercedes G-Wagon’s and Land Cruisers. I wonder how that happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolias-150000-license-plate/g-wagon.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The G-Wagon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mercedes-Benz_G_63_AMG_2012.JPG&quot;&gt;Source: Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general public always knew what was really happening. At one point frustration was so high that there was discussion of giving these lucky numbers to garbage trucks or other city vehicles. It seems their voice was heard when the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legalinfo.mn/annex/details/11395?lawid=15748&quot;&gt;Motor Vehicle Registration Country Number Procedure&lt;/a&gt; was approved in late 2020. This procedure set up a system to allow “lucky” numbers to be auctioned on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://Vehicle%20registration%20department&quot;&gt;Vehicle Registration Department’s website&lt;/a&gt;. This has been generally viewed as a positive development, as those willing to pay for this special license plate could pay legally for the privilege and contribute to government revenue and social programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure anyone expected what happened next. On February 15, 2021, the number 0001-УАР had its day to be auctioned. The first bid was 1,000,000 MNT (approximately $350 USD). Let’s see what happened…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolias-150000-license-plate/chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction opened at 9:00AM. In less than 30 minutes bids for 0001-УАР reached the equivalent of $100,000. By 11:30AM the auction total reached 427.45 million MNT (Mongolian Tugriks). &lt;strong&gt;That’s $150,035.10 USD at current exchange rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone bidding on a license plate number is required to put in a deposit for their bid of 50,000 MNT (about $17 USD). There were 957 bids for 0001-УАР. Those who didn’t win the auction will have their deposits returned. The winning bid is now expected to pay the total amount. If they don’t pay or are unable to, this number will go up for auction again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how much of this auction was real interest or social media hype, as this particular license plate went somewhat viral on various Mongolian language Facebook groups. To put things in perspective, the average yearly salary in Ulaanbaatar, the capital, is about $5,300 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, towards the end of each year China’s coal imports decline, only to restart with vigor early the next year. Argus media, a media organization focused on commodities, say that this slowdown, officially blamed on customs clearance issues, has happened for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2064083-chinese-coking-coal-imports-rise-by-153pc-in-2019?mc_cid=1f9728d1ea&amp;amp;mc_eid=723326a57c&quot;&gt;the past two years&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, this official explanation has shown a remarkable regularity at the end of the year when China has mostly satisfied its domestic need for coal. In both 2018 and 2019 around November, a line of coal trucks &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mn/en/789843/?mc_cid=113b6a9ec2&amp;amp;mc_eid=723326a57c&quot;&gt;kilometers long&lt;/a&gt; would sit at Mongolia’s southern border with China in below freezing temperatures waiting to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as November, New Hope, and Australian coal miner, said they believed Australian coal imports were simply being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/new-hope-says-china-shifting-coal-shipments-to-january-20201117-p56fdx&quot;&gt;delayed until January&lt;/a&gt;. Yet this year seems to be different. The recent trade spat between China and Australia has resulted in China eliminating clearance restrictions from several countries, except for Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/australias-loss-mongolias-gain/two-big-players.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since July, Mongolia’s coal export has been ramping up and trying to make up ground that it lost due to coal exports dipping to near zero in March. Mongolia’s Finance Ministry stated in 2019 that mining revenues made up &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloombergtv.mn/%D1%82%D3%A9%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%8B%D0%BD-%D3%A9%D1%81%D3%A9%D0%BB%D1%82-%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%8B%D0%BD-%D3%A9%D1%81%D3%A9%D0%BB%D1%82%D3%A9%D3%A9%D1%81-4-%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8D%D1%8D%D1%80-%D3%A9%D0%BD%D0%B4%D3%A9%D1%80-%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0/?cid=3&quot;&gt;27% of the state budget&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, prior to just a few days ago Mongolia might have been looking at a hard slowdown of customs clearance for coal exports at the border in November. This race to the finish has not been kind, with total mineral products exports down $10.7 billion USD at the end of November, year over year, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://1212.mn&quot;&gt;National Statistical Office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the spat between Australia and China would seen to be an opportunity for Mongolia, it is important to keep in mind the type of coal that Mongolia predominantly exports to China. Since 2019, 85% of Mongolia’s coal export to China has been coking coal, which is used in blast furnaces as part of the steel production process. During the same period, only 42% of Australia’s export to China is coking coal, with a large portion of the rest being used for thermal coal to generate electricity and heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for the past few years Mongolia has been running up against China’s de facto coal quotas. With Australia sidelined, Mongolia has a significant opportunity to ramp up coking coal exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/australias-loss-mongolias-gain/australia-loss.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Mongolia’s share of coking coal exports hovered around 50% of China’s total import. In 2020 Australia filled the gap left by Mongolia and in March accounted for nearly 80% of China’s coking coal imports. Now it is Mongolia’s turn to fill the gap. If Australian coal imports remain stranded at sea, Mongolia could increase coking coal exports significantly in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges remain for Mongolia. Currently coal is still trucked to China, and the under construction Tavan-Tolgoi Gashuunsukhait railroad is scheduled to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://montsame.mn/en/read/231951&quot;&gt;completed in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. This railroad will improve margins by reducing transportation costs and speed customs clearance, which will result in higher revenues and increase export ability. Until then, the main bottleneck is still customs clearance with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recently opened “green channel”, which optimizes clearance of cross-border freight and related personnel, has been said to help. Yet due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mongolia, China insisted truck drivers entering the country be tested before being allowed to cross the border. Currently there is a big opportunity in front of Mongolia, and we will see early in 2021 if it can take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Ritz</name></author><category term="coal" /><category term="export" /><summary type="html">Note: This article originally appeared on Mongolia Weekly.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/australias-loss-mongolias-gain/article-cover.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/australias-loss-mongolias-gain/article-cover.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sqair Air Purifier Real World Test</title><link href="https://mongoliandatastories.com/Sqair-real-world-test" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sqair Air Purifier Real World Test" /><published>2019-09-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-09-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://mongoliandatastories.com/Sqair-real-world-test</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mongoliandatastories.com/Sqair-real-world-test">&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-put-the-new-sqair-air-purifier-from-smart-air-to-the-test-in-a-controlled-experiment&quot;&gt;I put the new Sqair air purifier from Smart Air to the test in a controlled experiment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter is coming, and we know what that means in Ulaanbaatar. Extremely high levels of air pollution. Even with the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://montsame.mn/en/read/189503&quot;&gt;ban on the burning of raw coal&lt;/a&gt; it is possible (even likely) that levels of the particularly dangerous pollutant PM2.5 will remain high during the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these months a pollution mask and air purifier are essential equipment to protect yourself and your family. Air purifiers can cost anywhere from $150-$500 or more. This means many families choose to forgo air purifiers completely, at the cost of their entire families health. Smart Air, a social enterprise founded in 2013, wants to change this situation with the launch of their new no-nonsense air purifier, the Sqair. Funded through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartair/the-sqair-the-worlds-most-cost-effective-air-purifier/description&quot;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt; in June, the Sqair purports to be the world’s most cost effective air purifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sqair-real-world-test/top.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
*Top view of the Sqair. Simple rotating controls.**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sqair-real-world-test/left.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Sqair in our small 10m² test room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sqair was kind enough to lend me a unit for a few days to test it out. I’ll first give my general thoughts on the device and then present my experiment to show how effective the Sqair is at removing PM2.5 from a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very pleased with the look of the device as it didn’t stick out as much as other air purifiers (the IQ Air purifier looks like an industrial battery). The controls are dead simple with three options: off, 1, 2, and 3. &lt;em&gt;Fan speed 1&lt;/em&gt; is very quiet (like very quiet). &lt;em&gt;Fan speed 2&lt;/em&gt; is certainly audible even in a room with a little background noise, but it easily blends in. &lt;em&gt;Fan speed 3&lt;/em&gt; is downright noisy, but as you will see below there isn’t much need to use this speed unless you are looking to really move some air through the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-experiment&quot;&gt;The Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I really wanted to test was how effective the Sqair is at clearing pollution from a room. I’ve heard criticism about air purifiers from several people who are skeptical of how well they circulate air. The common question is, “How do I know it isn’t just cleaning the air in one corner of the room?”. So I set up an experiment to see how well the Sqair works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my school we have a quiet study room that is 10m² and has ceilings of 3 meters. That makes 30 cubic meters of air in the room. The room has a door that seals completely and has no air vents. This made the perfect room to conduct an experiment with an air purifier. The only problem is that in early September there is essentially no air pollution outside, and inside PM2.5 levels hover around 5 µg/m³. So I had to get creative and make some air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sqair-real-world-test/camera-sensor.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Timelapse camera pointing at a laser PM2.5 sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sqair-real-world-test/pollution-source.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Artificial pollution source (арц).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mongolia арц (ground Juniper leaf) is commonly burned for religious purposes. It turns out it also is a great source of PM2.5! I poured a few grams of the green powder in a cup and lit it up. The sensor I was using maxes out around 1,500 µg/m³, and after only a few minutes of burning it reached the max! Keep in mind that air is considered “good” by the US EPA if the PM2.5 level is below an average of 12 µg/m³ over 24 hours (the Mongolian standard states that the air is clean below an average of 50 µg/m³ over 24 hours)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the following process to run the experiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The air purifier and air quality sensor were placed on opposite sides of the room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Burn the арц for a few minutes until the PM2.5 level spikes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the air purifier to a speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for 90 minutes while the camera records a timelapse of the air quality sensor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also ran a separate test with the air purifier off for 90 minutes to set a baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were quite amazing! It’s one thing to know that your air purifier is keeping your air clean, it’s another to see it working in real-time. Let’s take a look at the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sqair-real-world-test/chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before running the test I was quite concerned that the very very quite speed 1 wouldn’t circulate the air enough to clean the room’s air. It turns out that even on fan speed 1 the air was being cleaned at a very steady rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the fan speed 2 test, it seemed the air was moving around quite a bit more, and for a brief time, the PM2.5 levels went down and then up again. The fan speed 3 test was almost comical in how quickly the air was cleaned. I actually ended it early because I saw no use in continuing it after 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the results were what I expected for speeds 2, and 3, but better than expected for speed 1. In a larger room, fan speed 1 &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; not circulate air enough to clean it well. However, this will depend greatly on the room and I couldn’t give a definitive answer based on my test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was quite impressed with the simplicity, effectiveness, and cost of the Sqair. It just works and it does so while looking good and not breaking the bank. I can easily recommend these air purifiers to anyone looking for a simple and cost-effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current election saw a switch back to the block voting system used in 1992 and 2008. This system has both &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.ubc.ca/mongolia/2019/plurality-at-large-voting-revisited-for-2020/&quot;&gt;positives and negatives&lt;/a&gt;, and this system has much larger election districts than the previous single-member districts of the 2016 election. This allows us to more easily analyze the districts with the available data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put all of the data together and make it user friendly, I built an interactive data explorer that allows the reader to see key indicators of election districts. The indicators covered in the app include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population indicators&lt;/strong&gt;: population, household size, herder percent, age group breakdown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic indicators (self-reported)&lt;/strong&gt;: salary, household loans, employment, education levels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of life indicators&lt;/strong&gt;: crime, house type, toilet &amp;amp; water type, heating type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data was collected from &lt;a href=&quot;http://1212.mn&quot;&gt;1212.mn&lt;/a&gt; and also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.nso.mn/nada/index.php/catalog/115&quot;&gt;Household Socioeconomic Survey of 2016&lt;/a&gt;, which is the latest survey that contains precise geographic labeling. Both data sources are maintained by the National Statistics Office of Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several themes developed through my research into this data. These themes are perhaps not surprising for many readers familiar with Mongolia, but it is never a bad thing to back up observations with data. I encourage you, the reader, to explore the app yourself (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mongolia-2020-election.anvil.app&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), but below I give an overview of the themes for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ulaanbaatar-vs-countryside&quot;&gt;Ulaanbaatar vs Countryside&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best-known difference in Mongolia is that of Ulaanbaatar and the countryside. The image of busy urban Ulaanbaatar juxtaposed with the bucolic countryside could hardly be more different. Indeed the data shows significant differences in many areas. Let’s compare the population pyramid for the election district with the highest population, Songinokhairkhan District in Ulaanbaatar, with the least populace, Bulgan Aimag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/population-pyramid.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious population difference, but the size of the age groups also shows a marked difference between the two. Where you have a large spike in the 20–40 age group in Songinokhairkhan, Bulgans’ age groups have much less variability and are quite flat from 15–50. You will see a similar trend in the highest population election districts compared with the least populated ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the voting demographics in rural areas are more widely distributed than in urban areas. D.Byambjav and E.Gerelt-Od &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.ubc.ca/mongolia/2020/voter-demography/&quot;&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt; the large and less engaged block of voters under 35. If youth engagement initiatives are successful, this block of voters will be less powerful in rural districts that have a similar age distribution to Bulgan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/percentage-employed.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment differs significantly as well between Ulaanbaatar and most rural districts. Rural election districts tend to show significantly higher rates of overall employment than the urban ones. In the chart above, the “employed percentage” refers to the proportion of the working-age population that is employed. Urban districts tend to have between 45–55% employment, with rural districts between 65–75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/average-salary.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salaries are also significantly higher in Ulaanbaatar. The salaries shown above are self-reported from 2016, but they show a very clear picture. Employment levels may be higher in rural areas, but salary levels are conversely lower. This is an obvious area where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.ubc.ca/mongolia/2020/guest-post-economic-policy-party-platforms/&quot;&gt;economic policy of the party platforms&lt;/a&gt; could address these inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outliers-mining-areas-and-bayan-ulgii&quot;&gt;Outliers: Mining Areas and Bayan-Ulgii&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ulaanbaatar vs countryside theme may be the biggest theme in the data, it doesn’t give the full picture. There are two sets of outliers that “buck the trend”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that the two primary mining areas of Mongolia, Erdenet (in Orkhon) and Oyu Toloig (in Umnugovi), show significantly higher salaries, lower loan rates, and higher educations than other rural election districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/loans-vs-salary.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bubble plot shows the percent of households with loans vs monthly average salaries in each election district. The two highlighted in red are Orkhon (lower right) and Umnugovi (upper left). All of the bubbles above 550k average monthly salary except for the two in red are located in Ulaanbaatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two election districts (and the urban workforce where the company offices are) have benefited heavily from the mining industry of Mongolia. Industrialization as proposed in the party platforms would most likely further benefit these areas, as this is where the raw materials would come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/loans-vs-salary2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second outlier is Bayan-Ulgii. In the chart above, the red bubble to the farthest left is Bayan-Ulgii, and the red bubble on the far right is Khan-Uul District. The average household size is 5.2, significantly larger than the most populace district Songinokhairkhan of 3.8. Besides larger family sizes, Bayan-Ulgii has the lowest average monthly salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ulaanbaatar-districts-have-diverseneeds&quot;&gt;Ulaanbaatar Districts Have Diverse Needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The districts of Ulaanbaatar also show diverse needs. Every district also contains part of the ger district. This means that there is a mix of urban and peri-urban in every election district of Ulaanbaatar. In the center of the city, households are connected to the central water, heating, and sewage systems. In the ger district, living standards become sharply different, with no central heat or water connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/heating-type.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique layout of the city districts ensures that at least 20% of the population of each district uses pit toilets and wood or coal for heat. More than 40% of Khan-Uul district households, the most affluent election district in Mongolia, use ordinary wood and coal stoves for heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mps-will-represent-very-diversegroups&quot;&gt;MPs Will Represent Very Diverse Groups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the outcome of the election, it is clear that the needs of citizens in election districts are not uniform, and even the common trope of UB vs the rest doesn’t hold up completely. Even though Mongolia a small country with a heavy focus on mining, it isn’t clear that the party platforms address the inequalities mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the economics platforms of the DP, MPP, and Right Person Electorate all &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.ubc.ca/mongolia/2020/guest-post-economic-policy-party-platforms/&quot;&gt;focus on heavy industry&lt;/a&gt;, it isn’t clear how heavy industry would help rural areas outside of the main mining areas lacking in high paying jobs, or whether it would increase employment levels in Ulaanbaatar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Ritz</name></author><category term="election" /><category term="parliament" /><summary type="html">2020 Parliamentary Election</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/cover.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/mongolian-electoral-analysis-2020/cover.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mongolian Meat Price Time Series Forecast</title><link href="https://mongoliandatastories.com/Mongolian-meat-price-time-series-forecast" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mongolian Meat Price Time Series Forecast" /><published>2019-05-20T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-05-20T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://mongoliandatastories.com/Mongolian-meat-price-time-series-forecast</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mongoliandatastories.com/Mongolian-meat-price-time-series-forecast">&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-the-land-of-eternal-blue-skies-and-nearly-70-million-animals-meat-is-getting-expensive&quot;&gt;In the land of eternal blue skies and nearly 70 million animals, meat is getting expensive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since September 2018 the average price per kilogram of mutton in Ulaanbaatar has increased by 35% (beef increased 26%). News outlets have been buzzing with talk of these price increases and even meat shortages. Headlines from many news outlets make it seem as if the sky is falling (see below for a particularly sensational headline from Ikon.mn). I hope to explain the market forces at play here and hopefully better understand why prices are at record highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/roller_coaster.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time series of beef and mutton prices from 2011 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-meat-works-inmongolia&quot;&gt;How Meat Works in Mongolia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mongolia, meat prices are highly seasonal, with meat prices rising in the Spring and then falling in the Fall. The meat supply itself comes from nomadic herders who make up roughly 30% of the population. But these herders do not operate with anything resembling a western mode of production. Their behavior has more to do with herd health and preparations for the various challenges of each season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/ikon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt; section of Ikon.mn. Headline translation: “The price of meat is skyrocketing and there is a shortage!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a rough generalization of the behavior of herders. This, of course, does not speak for all herders but from what I have observed this is relatively typical behavior. In the Fall before winter sets in herders will slaughter or sell those animals which are likely to die in the coming winter. Then in the Spring during breeding season herders often restrict the amount they sell so as not to limit their potential growth that year. In the Summer the productive animals are known and herders are more willing to sell or slaughter those animals that are not pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this cycle, it is clear that seasonal prices are primarily being driven by the supply of meat. Prices go down in the Fall, hit the bottom in the Winter, and then rise dramatically in the Spring, reaching the peak in the Summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the supply of meat, the government purchases extra meat when prices are generally low and freeze it for use in times when supply is lower. This program has been going on for several years and the Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikon.mn/n/1ko9&quot;&gt;recently stated they will increase the supply of this reserve meat on the market&lt;/a&gt;. However, based on available data it is not clear whether this program actually works or does not. This reserve meat is frozen for several months and, from what I have observed, is much less desirable in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-increasing-exports-causing-recordprices&quot;&gt;Are increasing exports causing record prices?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a short introduction to how the market works in Mongolia, let’s take a look at the factor most are blaming for the price increases, &lt;strong&gt;exports&lt;/strong&gt;. Recently I was interview on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mnbworld&quot;&gt;MNB World&lt;/a&gt;’s weekly news program. Through this, I learned of the concern that international traders (particularly from China) are being blamed for buying meat in bulk, thus causing a meat shortage and prices to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this better I wanted to see if meat prices correlated with exports. After all, meat exports are not a new thing in Mongolia. If these exports were causing a fluctuation in the price of meat we should see these correlations. So let’s take a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/exports_rising.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blue shaded bar chart is animal product exports (in tons), and the two lines are beef and mutton prices (all prices in this article are Ulaanbaatar averages). As the chart title says, the connection isn’t clear. Export rose dramatically in 2017 and 2018. There may be a lag where 2017 exports impact prices in 2018 and 2018 exports impact prices in 2019, but this doesn’t make too much sense (meat goes bad after a few months being frozen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 exports more than doubled from 2016, but average meat prices actually went down. We do see another dramatic increase in exports in 2018, but prices reached the same high from 2015. Simply put, exports may be causing prices to increase, but I do not believe it is the main driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Exports may be causing prices to increase, but I do not believe it is the main driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;38-loss-in2018&quot;&gt;3.8% loss in 2018&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much talk of dzud last winter. In fact, international NGO’s barely mentioned the fact that last year saw more adult animals die than any year since 2010. A total of 2.6 million adult animals were lost in 2018. Let’s visualize the adult animal loss and meat price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/animal_losses.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010 over 10 million adult animals died. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zud&quot;&gt;It was the last major dzud&lt;/a&gt;. Late 2010 then saw a dramatic rise in prices. I’m still unsure why we didn’t see a fast rise in prices. This was the same year Ulaanbaatar saw an explosion of people moving to the city. Perhaps them selling their herds caused a long enough increase in the supply to delay the rising prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the large number of animals lost in 2018 is a very likely explanation for rising prices this Spring. Most likely both are responsible, as well as other external factors like &lt;strong&gt;rising salaries&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;fuel prices&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-happened-to-inflation&quot;&gt;What happened to inflation?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the consumer price index (CPI) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1212.mn/tables.aspx?tbl_id=DT_NSO_0600_001V2&amp;amp;CPI_001_select_all=0&amp;amp;CPI_001SingleSelect=_1&amp;amp;YearM_select_all=1&amp;amp;YearMSingleSelect=&amp;amp;viewtype=linechart&quot;&gt;has gone up 84%&lt;/a&gt;. Annual inflation is somewhere between 6–9%. Given these numbers, it only makes sense that prices would go up. Yet since 2011 meat prices have been remarkably stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this I took the monthly change in CPI from MongolBank and calculated &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;meat prices would be if they tracked inflation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/beef.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/mutton.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 2015 both mutton and beef trended above inflation. Then from 2016 to 2018 mutton was below inflation, with beef above. Now we see both again trending above the calculated inflation. What we can learn from this is that rising meat prices are not unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices go up because of inflation. If they don’t go up, but the currency value is decreasing due to inflation, that meat the &lt;em&gt;real price&lt;/em&gt; of meat actually &lt;em&gt;went down&lt;/em&gt; since 2012 when there was a large spike. This increase in price could simply be a reversion to the inflation trend that you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mongolians-are-richer-than-they-were-8-yearsago&quot;&gt;Mongolians are richer than they were 8 years ago&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, let’s remember that since 2010 wages have also increased quite a bit. In 2010 the average monthly wage was 345,000 MNT in Ulaanbaatar. In 2018 it was 1,119,700 MNT. That is an increase of 225%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the currently rising meat prices, do you think that the amount of money the average person spends on meat has gone up since 2011?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/meat_income.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you said yes, think again! Let’s assume that an ‘average’ person in Ulaanbaatar (making an average salary) has a family of three and each person eats 250 grams of meat per day (this is equivalent to the average US meat consumption per person in 2018) for a total of 750 grams of consumption for the family. Based on these assumptions we saw a reduction of around 7% for both mutton and beef as a percent of the average salary spent on meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tsuivanindex&quot;&gt;The Tsuivan Index&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the inflation of prices since 2011, I wanted to see how the price of other common items and service has changed. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.en.nso.mn/&quot;&gt;National Statistics Office of Mongolia&lt;/a&gt; (NSO) has recorded the average price of common goods and services going back to December 2010. Below, I’ve created an index for a selection of goods and services by setting the December 2010 price as 100. If prices increase or decrease it will show as a proportion of the December 2010 price (i.e. 100). In this way, you can effectively see the &lt;em&gt;percent change&lt;/em&gt; in prices since December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/haircuts.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above chart, you can see that beef is about 250% more expensive (2.5 times) than in December 2010. Mutton is about 240% more expensive. What is interesting is the increase in prices for the other items. Here is a description of each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restaurant Gulyash — This is the price of a typical goulash meal (including potato salad and tea) in Ulaanbaatar at a typical restaurant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tsuivan — This is the price of a plate of Tsuivan (including milk tea) at a ‘tsainii gazar’, which is a canteen style of food establishment common across Mongolia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Men Haircut — The price of a men’s haircut in Ulaanbaatar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Women’s Haircut — The price for a ‘simple’ women’s haircut in Ulaanbaatar. For obvious reasons, they don’t track more complicated haircuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most shocking price increases were for haircuts. Haircutting is a service business, and there is little in the way of materials needed other than the expertise of the person. In addition, haircuts are not imported and could be said to be a “Mongolian” product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, haircuts are of course not as necessary as meat for the average person, and haircuts can be performed at home. Other products like chips, Coca Cola, and other packaged foods aren’t tracked by the NSO, but based on my observations since 2012, they have increased significantly in price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;becoming-the-meat-priceprophet&quot;&gt;Becoming the Meat Price Prophet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a big fan of time series forecasts. They are generally too general and not accurate enough to truly understand a problem. I’ve written about time series forecasting a few times in the past. Both times (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mongolian-data-stories/forecasting-usd-mnt-exchange-rate-part-1-prophet-4e95ecadf9b2&quot;&gt;USD-MNT exchange rate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mongolian-data-stories/using-facebooks-prophet-to-predict-mongolian-stocks-cdf4feabd558&quot;&gt;MSE stocks&lt;/a&gt;) didn’t give good results. But it seems that for meat prices it might not be too bad! Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in November 2018, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Open Source Prophet&lt;/a&gt; library to forecast mutton and beef prices (as a bonus on the USD-MNT exchange rate article). For reference (and to show the limitations of time series forecasts), here are the forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/feed_forecast.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/mutton_forecast.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these forecasts our predictions were quite a bit off. But these forecasts don’t take into consideration animal losses, exports, or anything other than the seasonal trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prophet allows the addition of ‘regressors’, which are simply other variables that impact the prediction. What I did this time was take the previous years animal loss and added it to the model. In addition, I took the average yearly loss since 2011 (1.1 million animals) and assumed that would be the animal loss for the next two years. Here is the output of these two models, one for mutton and one for beef. I chose not to forecast other meat types as beef and mutton are by far the most popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/forecast.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meat_prices/forecast1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each one the blue line is the average forecast, the black dots are the actual average prices, and the blue shaded area is the 80% confidence interval. The short story is that the peak price is almost over and &lt;em&gt;we should expect a reduction in prices in June&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that these forecasts are more accurate than my previous ones because it includes one of the primary drivers of price, animal loss. However, it will be important to add additional features if you wanted to get a more accurate forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence agents “inspected” meat exporters. I assume they found meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the General Intelligence Agency (equivalent to the FBI in the US) &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikon.mn/n/1ks5&quot;&gt;conducted a search&lt;/a&gt; of meat exporters warehouses. This implies there may be some conspiracy to raise meat prices or that exporters are hoarding meat to then sell back later at higher prices. This seems pretty ridiculous on the face of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meat frozen more than a week is very undesirable on the market in Mongolia, and generally is offered at a much lower price. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry say that their reserve meat is designed to provide a lower cost option for low-income families. This reserve meat is bought when prices are low (the Fall) and then sold in the Spring. This is not the first choice for any family. In most food markets in Ulaanbaatar, you buy meat that has been slaughtered that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolia’s meat prices are a function it’s nomadic supply. Regulating meat prices would only hurt the nearly 30% of the country that is engaged in herding work. These herders also don’t have a large household income compared to Ulaanbaatar. Rising meat prices means more money in their pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one question that hasn’t been discussed much. Who is hurt by rising meat prices? Low-income households have government reserve meat as an option. Average and upper-income households (assuming consistent consumption) spend a smaller portion of their income on meat compared to 2010. Let’s not forget that more meat exports contribute to the stability of the Tugrik and help diversify Mongolia’s economy so it isn’t so reliant on mining.

&lt;p&gt;In this book and in a forthcoming research paper, O’Neil proposes that algorithms don’t just predict the future, they can also &lt;em&gt;create it.&lt;/em&gt; As such she proposes the use of an “Ethical Matrix” be completed before such an algorithm is implemented. This matrix is designed to understand the real impact of an algorithm. It aims to explicitly answer &lt;em&gt;who the algorithm is impacting and how&lt;/em&gt; in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fairness: is the algorithm truly fair to all those impacted?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transparency: do we have visibility as to how the algorithm is making its decisions?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;False Negatives: how are stakeholders impacted by false negatives?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;False Positives: how are stakeholders impacted by false positives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this matrix important? As algorithms are being applied in more areas of our lives, there is often little regard to their full impact. Here are just a few examples of algorithms and their unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2015 Google’s auto-tagging photo feature embarrassed the company by labeling a black person a gorilla. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/&quot;&gt;Google still has this problem.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recently a significant amount of scrutiny was placed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1276781/algorithms-are-making-the-same-mistakes-assessing-credit-scores-that-humans-did-a-century-ago/&quot;&gt;algorithmic credit scoring&lt;/a&gt;. These supposedly fair algorithms show a surprising bias in areas such as race. In one example an algorithm reduced credit scores for customers that had a bank charge for “counseling”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon has used an algorithm to assess recruits applying for jobs at the company. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G&quot;&gt;This algorithm&lt;/a&gt; appeared to have a strong gender bias against women. Amazon says they never put it in production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these potential consequences, it’s a good idea to evaluate any potential new algorithm to better understand how it could hurt those it impacts. A recently released algorithm in Mongolia inspired me to do just this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;livestock-mortality-index&quot;&gt;Livestock Mortality Index&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2018 a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reliefweb.int/report/mongolia/advancing-understanding-dzud-risk-livestock-mortality-model-and-multi-indicator-dzud&quot;&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; was released by People in Need, an international NGO, that proposes a livestock mortality index to perhaps provide an early warning for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zud&quot;&gt;dzud&lt;/a&gt; in Mongolia. This index would assign a value from 0–5 for each aimag (province) that would describe the risk of dzud in that aimag for the next winter. As dzud is perhaps the largest natural disaster Mongolia faces, being able to accurately assess the risk of dzud is a very important step in making herding a sustainable livelihood long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Government of Mongolia has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://eic.mn/dzud/index.php&quot;&gt;risk map model&lt;/a&gt; (at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_%28country_subdivision%29&quot;&gt;soum&lt;/a&gt; level) in place that was implemented in 2015/2016 and is updated every 10 days. The way in which the proposed index is different is the lead time it would provide to prepare areas that are at the highest risk. Instead of identifying a sudden issue up to 10 days in advance, there would be an indicator of risk months ahead of time. This would give the government and non-governmental actors time to preposition fodder or other materials long before a dzud occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paper, the authors make clear that this index is not intended to be a forecast, but rather an indicator of risk. However, as this is essentially an algorithm that is attempting to predict the future, I thought this was the perfect time to apply the Ethical Matrix to a Mongolian case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethical-matrix&quot;&gt;Ethical Matrix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the algorithm we will look at four areas: &lt;strong&gt;fairness, transparency, false negatives,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;false positives&lt;/strong&gt;. To quickly summarize the algorithm, it uses 7 indicators to create a score from 0–5 (ex. 0.1, 1.4, 2.3, 4, 4.4) for each aimag. The higher the number the higher the risk. The indicators are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Winter temperature anomaly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Snowfall anomaly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biomass anomaly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pasture use anomaly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zootechnical scores (a combination of past mortality and female reproductivity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fairness&quot;&gt;Fairness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of fairness is the general question of whether the algorithm treats those impacted by it equally. In this, the algorithm does quite well. One area of concern is the metric of forage biomass (the amount of forage available). Given the disparity between the south of Mongolia and the north, this is an area where an imbalance could occur. The authors handle this by looking at the anomaly (or change in) biomass to ensure areas with disparate biomass are not treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ethical-matrix-dzud-forecasting/biomass.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transparency&quot;&gt;Transparency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency in an algorithm is a difficult thing to accomplish. As these are computer models, it isn’t as simple as asking the computer ‘&lt;em&gt;Why did you do that?’&lt;/em&gt;. However, what we can do is understand how the inputs are related to the outputs. For example, if I change one thing how does this change the score (higher/lower). In this way, we can understand “how” the algorithm is coming to its conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm here again does this quite well. As it is a linear model, we have coefficients for each variable. These coefficients are basically weights on the variables that are combined with the variables themselves to generate a score. The model equation is given and as such we can determine how each variable impacts the final risk score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ethical-matrix-dzud-forecasting/page16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page 16 of the MDVI report&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;false-positives-and-negatives&quot;&gt;False Positives and Negatives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to have a fair and transparent algorithm, but what if it fails in certain ways that can cause harm? This is what we try to assess when looking at false positives and false negatives. A false positive in this case is a high-risk score (a “positive” result for high dzud risk) when little to no mortality occurred. The opposite situation is a false negative, where the risk score is low but high mortality results. Both are undesirable but for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Positives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A false positive is also known as “crying wolf”. The result can be similar to the fable, with an erosion of trust in the model after several attempts to prevent disaster over the long term. In the short term, a false positive can waste resources that could otherwise be used in areas that need them more. Over the long term, the larger movement to stop a dzud from happening could be undermined with herders, governments, and NGO’s withdrawing from the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.ubc.ca/mongolia/2017/crying-wolf-dzud/&quot;&gt;false dzud alarms&lt;/a&gt; was discussed in 2017 by Julian Dierkes, a professor at the University of British Columbia and a well-known observer of Mongolia. This critical look at false positives shows how not only data can undermine the system, but the perception of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Negative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A false negative can have dire consequences. In this situation, high mortality would occur with the model indicating a low risk. This would mean that enough fodder or other materials may not be readily available on short notice to help in aimags falsely designated as low risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would have more extreme short term consequences not only for livestock but also for trust in the model. If a model has even a few false negatives it very likely could be thrown out and labeled untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;confusion-matrix&quot;&gt;Confusion Matrix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, when optimizing a machine learning model it is good to ask whether false positives or false negatives are worse. For this model, it is conceivable that several false positives could be tolerated, although with an erosion of trust and possibly less mobilization for each subsequent false positive. However, it would be disastrous to have even a few false negatives in the real world. Livestock could die by the hundreds of thousands and the area could be devastated economically. For this reason, I believe that false negatives for this are much less desirable and should be minimized as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study made available the predicted risk scores and the livestock mortality numbers for the years in question. With this data, we can create a confusion matrix that will allow us to visualize our false positives and negatives. As the authors did not give bins for the index values, we will simplify things a bit and bin them ourselves. The bins are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Index, Mortality %&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0–1, [0%-3%]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–2, (3%-6%]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2–3, (6%-17%]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3+, (17%+)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the corresponding confusion matrix. TP = True Positive, TN = True Negative, FP = False Positive, FN = False Negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ethical-matrix-dzud-forecasting/confusion-matrix.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Confusion matrix derived from MVDI risk scores&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewing this confusion matrix we see a relatively small number of true positives or negatives (about 15% of the total). If this were a classification task this would be quite undesirable. However, the model is set up as a regression task, so this isn’t necessarily bad. Of more interest are the FP’s and FN’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The false positives are the large majority here. As we established that we want to minimize FN’s due to their destructive potential, this is a positive sign. However, FP’s are nearly 74% of the values. Given this, it should be known that this model will consistently overstate the risk values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to solve the issue with FP’s and FN’s is to restate the task as a classification one. Currently, as regression, the output plotted against real values is shown in figure 5. While it’s simple to say that higher values mean higher risk, what is one aimag has “1.5” and the other has “2.2”. Should more resources be provided to the higher risk even though we know this model has a high false positive ratio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ethical-matrix-dzud-forecasting/mdvi-index-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resulting index values from MDVI model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By changing the problem to a classification one we can allow the user of the model to make more intuitive decisions from the output of the model. Instead of numeric values, the output of the model could be “low”, “medium”, and “high”. This may in itself be too simple, but if the classes are based on actual results from real data, then they will have a higher interpretive ability in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an important step for any machine learning or algorithmic project to take time to understand how it’s results can impact stakeholders and the system as a whole. The authors state that this model was not designed as a dzud forecast. However, once they release it in the real world NGO’s and governments can interpret the results how they wish. As such, there is a very real responsibility to understand how these values can be interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Ritz</name></author><category term="dzud" /><category term="forecasting" /><summary type="html">In 2016 a pivotal book in the field of data science was released.

The city government, worried about traffic, only allows cars to drive during alternate days on the weekend. The bakeries are so consumed with making &lt;em&gt;ul boov&lt;/em&gt;, a traditional pastry, that bread starts to disappear from store shelves the week before the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like quite a lot, but it is just the run-up to the actual event, Tsagaan Sar, Mongolia’s lunar new year celebration. The main activity of the holiday (which goes on for three days) is where family (and extended family) visit their elders in their home. The guests traditionally bring money as a gift for their elders, and the guests are given gifts (sometimes small, sometimes large) in addition to a truly magnificent feast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video below shows the preparation of one of the signature dishes of Tsagaan Sar, &lt;em&gt;buuz&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsagaan Sar Preparation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BymB9IYd2xE&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cost&quot;&gt;The Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year new outlets write many articles sharing the costs of Tsagaan Sar. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mn/r/770526/&quot;&gt;News.mn estimated&lt;/a&gt; this year that cost for one family is about 1.32 million MNT (about $500 USD). To put his in perspective, more than half of those employed make less than &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnn.mn/%D1%86%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80-%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D1%86%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD-%D1%82%D1%8D%D1%82%D0%B3%D1%8D%D0%B2%D1%8D%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD-%D0%B7%D1%8D%D1%8D%D0%BB/&quot;&gt;$200 per month&lt;/a&gt;. A survey completed by a market research firm and reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloombergtv.mn/%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%8D%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD-62-%D1%85%D1%83%D0%B2%D1%8C-%D0%BD%D1%8C-%D0%B7%D1%8D%D1%8D%D0%BB%D1%8D%D1%8D%D1%80-%D1%86%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80-%D1%82%D1%8D%D0%BC%D0%B4%D1%8D%D0%B3%D0%BB%D1%8D%D0%B6-357-%D1%82%D1%8D%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BC-%D1%82%D3%A9%D0%B3%D1%80%D3%A9%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%B3-%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD-%D0%B1%D1%8D%D0%BB%D1%8D%D0%B3%D1%82-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%86%D1%83%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B6-%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0/&quot;&gt;BloombergTV Mongolia&lt;/a&gt; concluded that 62% of those surveyed take out loans for the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about the cost of Tsagaan Sar for a few years now, but not in absolute costs. I’ve written before about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mongolian-data-stories/mongolians-are-more-in-debt-now-than-ever-7f797e448f77&quot;&gt;growing debt&lt;/a&gt; in Mongolia, and I wanted to see how the holiday impacted those who hold the greatest burden, the elders responsible for hosting 10’s or 100’s of guests. Phrased in a testable way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do pension or salary loans issuances show an increase for Tsagaan Sar separate from the rest of the year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loan-data&quot;&gt;Loan Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, MongolBank, the country’s central bank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongolbank.mn/eng/dbliststatistic.aspx?id=02&quot;&gt;keeps statistics&lt;/a&gt; many statistics on loans. I chose salary and pension loans because they are issued to individuals and are not (directly) used to purchase real estate. Pension loans are of particular interest because they are given using the government pension of the person as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the analysis I downloaded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongolbank.mn/eng/dbliststatistic.aspx?id=02&quot;&gt;quarterly report&lt;/a&gt; of “ Individual and SME loans issued by banks” and separated out salary and pension loans issued. The data is only available quarterly or annually. Quarterly actually suits our needs quite well as Tsagaan Sar always takes place in Q1 while the exact dates move every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tsagaan-sar-debt-cycle/dataframe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of our issued loans data. All numbers are in millions of MNT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s first take a look at the time series of both salary and pension loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tsagaan-sar-debt-cycle/salary-loans-issued.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tsagaan-sar-debt-cycle/pension-loans-issued.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the obvious large increases in both, the thing to notice is when each increases during the year. It is already noticeable that pension loans have a spike at the beginning of each year while salary loans spike later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do a trend analysis we can use the handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/prophet/&quot;&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; package from Facebook. There is a built-in seasonality tool that is perfect for this analysis. The tool is built on daily data analysis, so changes were made to accommodate a quarterly period (mainly reducing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html#fourier-order-for-seasonalities&quot;&gt;Fourier order&lt;/a&gt; for seasonality). The graphs below show the derived trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tsagaan-sar-debt-cycle/salary-loans-seasonal.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember when interpreting these graphs that as we only have one data point per quarter, Prophet is interpolating the trends between the quarters. For reference, quarters end March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salary loans do show a large trend in Q1, but the largest trend appears to be in Q3. Perhaps parents trying to get enough money to pay for school tuition, clothes, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tsagaan-sar-debt-cycle/pension-loan-seasonal.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pension loans have an obvious upward trend in Q1, with Q2 and Q3 being significantly smaller. Can we answer our question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do pension or salary loans issuances show an increase for Tsagaan Sar separate from the rest of the year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we certainly see a large increase in pension loans in Q1, which is when you would expect Tsagaan Sar expenditures, and therefore the need for cash. This certainly seems to fit with the narrative that the elderly are the most impacted, and are taking out loans specifically for the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if you visit a family next year for Tsagaan Sar you may consider giving a bit more money to help offset these costs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Ritz</name></author><category term="Tsagaan Sar" /><category term="debt" /><summary type="html">The entire country mobilizes weeks ahead of time to prepare.

&lt;p&gt;Data is everything in today’s economy. Without it, businesses, governments, and even consumers can make effective decisions. Daily in my work as a university instructor and data scientist, I look for data that can explain, illustrate, and answer questions and issues about Mongolia and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Data is the new oil. — Bryan Krzanich, Intel CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mongolia data (and the information that comes from it) are sometimes in short supply. So I wanted to put together a list of open data sources about Mongolia that can be used for analysis, research, business, etc. I will keep it updated as I find new sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are data sources that contain many different categories of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mongolian National Statistical Office&lt;/strong&gt;: A large amount of data on key macroeconomic and social data. This should be your first stop for national or regional data. Link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1212.mn/&quot;&gt;1212.mn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAQ&lt;/strong&gt;: Air quality in Mongolia’s capital isn’t great, and OpenAQ aggregates air quality measurements for over 40 locations in Mongolia. Data goes back to 2015 for most sensors in UB and back to 2017 for those outside UB. Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://openaq.org/#/countries/MN&quot;&gt;openaq.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CrimeMap&lt;/strong&gt;: Mongolia’s national police agency runs a database of reported crimes that are able to be mapped. The service doesn’t work very often, but when it does it is pretty interesting to look at. Also, I made a dashboard last year that uses data scraped from the crime map that you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://datastudio.google.com/open/1AUQACNWS9OMgiEvmJKFQPokI3Xw9NRbn&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimemap.police.gov.mn/&quot;&gt;crimemap.police.gov.mn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M-Lab&lt;/strong&gt;: Measurement Lab (M-Lab) has a mission to monitor and report on network (internet) performance around the world. Their open dataset (accessible through Google BigQuery) includes Mongolia and is freely accessible. Ever wanted to know how Mongolian internet compares to other countries? Which ISP is better? M-Lab can answer that. Warning, this dataset requires some network and big data knowledge (or at least SQL database knowledge). Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.measurementlab.net/data/&quot;&gt;measurementlab.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mongolian Stock Exchange&lt;/strong&gt;: The Mongolian Stock Exchange (MSE) recently added semi-annual financial reports for over 100 list companies in English. However what is lacking are the official definitions of these terms according to Mongolian accounting standards (which are different from GAAP or IFRS). Link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mse.mn/en/company_finance_report/120&quot;&gt;mse.mn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mongolia GIS Data&lt;/strong&gt;: One extremely useful set of data is from Christopher Free, a quantitative ecologist at Rutgers University. He has collected GIS (geographic information systems) data for borders, roads, and zones for Ulaanbaatar and the aimags. This is useful if you want to model data over a geographic space, like market penetration, crime, etc. I hope to add to this dataset soon with a Khoroo and District shapefiles for Ulaanbaatar. Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://marine.rutgers.edu/~cfree/gis-data/mongolia-gis-data/&quot;&gt;marine.rutgers.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government Ministries&lt;/strong&gt;: Each government ministry often has a statistics or data section on their website (often available only in Mongolian). Often the data is in the format of a PDF in a blog post, and isn’t very easy to access. The general government website zasag.mn has a list of government ministries and agencies along with their websites. Link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://zasag.mn/en/&quot;&gt;zasag.mn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-datamarket&quot;&gt;The Need for a Data Market&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above are the datasets that I am aware of. I’m sure there are more, and this highlights the need for a central data market for open data (or paid data). As Mongolia develops the need for high quality data, the demand for open data will skyrocket. I’ve considered doing this myself for some time, but the amount of work seems prohibitive for me alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a rather gloomy title, but it is appropriate. There has been much discussion about diversifying the Mongolian economy to avoid the boom and bust cycle that has become common (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@turtogtokherdenebaatar/opportunity-to-diversify-the-mongolian-economy-3b7f178339b1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalriskinsights.com/2016/04/mongolia-needs-to-diversify-to-avoid-recession/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/29/c_137074975.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to name a few). Less has been discussed regarding diversifying trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those familiar with the Mongolian economy, it is clear that China plays a big role in imports to the country. Yet I believe it is less known by the average Mongolian how closely exports are tied to China as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of the efforts of diversification, is the economy safer if nearly all of Mongolia’s exports go to one trading partner? Now factor in Chinese government whims to close the border &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/china-blocks-mongolia-border-dalai-lama-visit-161210060313417.html&quot;&gt;whenever it fancys&lt;/a&gt;. This seems to be a recipe for economic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand just how closely Mongolia’s exports are tied to China I gathered data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1212.mn/&quot;&gt;National Statistical Office&lt;/a&gt; and dug in. These data show Mongolia’s export value from 2005–2017 and is broken down by country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-exports&quot;&gt;Mapping Exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I wanted to visually see where Mongolia’s products and services are going around the world. I animated a global map, showing a new image for each year, and shaded the countries by the amount of exports going to that country. The darker the higher the value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolia-chained-china/exports-over-time.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China remains dark throughout the period while other trading partners get significantly lighter. There is only one country that ends darker than it started, the United Kingdom. Interestingly enough back in 2005 the United States was number two, yet was still far away from the export value of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolia-chained-china/exports-2005.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;charting-exports&quot;&gt;Charting Exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at real numbers now. But I warn you, they aren’t any prettier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolia-chained-china/charting-exports.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the massive proportion of exports going to China from Mongolia. Every other country is dwarfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;total-exports&quot;&gt;Total Exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it’s not all doom and gloom. Since 2005 Mongolia’s exports have increased tremendously, propelling the country’s economy to new heights. The total value has gone from just over 1 billion USD to over 6 billion USD today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolia-chained-china/exports-forecast.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total value of Mongolian exports with a linear forecast. Error bars shown are based on a 95% confidence interval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolian exports will continue to grow, and hopefully in a diversified way that includes more than natural resources and more than just China. Putting all your eggs in one basket is never a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Ritz</name></author><category term="trade" /><category term="china" /><summary type="html">That is, unless Mongolia’s export partners diversify</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/mongolia-chained-china/charting-exports.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/mongolia-chained-china/charting-exports.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mongolians are more in debt now than ever</title><link href="https://mongoliandatastories.com/Mongolian-more-in-debt-than-ever-before" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mongolians are more in debt now than ever" /><published>2018-05-08T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-05-08T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://mongoliandatastories.com/Mongolian-more-in-debt-than-ever-before</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mongoliandatastories.com/Mongolian-more-in-debt-than-ever-before">&lt;h4 id=&quot;but-they-are-also-richer&quot;&gt;But they are also richer.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/mongolia-s-swing-from-bust-to-boom-raises-question-can-it-last&quot;&gt;picking up steam&lt;/a&gt; in Mongolia. This is good news for the country’s businesses, who can hope the economic growth will translate to more money in peoples pockets. However, in a country that has experienced dramatic up and down swings of the economy, hope may not be in large supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I always tell my students, if you have a question, dig into it and test your hypothesis. My hypothesis is that debt levels may be reaching a critical amount that the economy can no longer bear. This will result in a lack of free cash for regular citizens and a weakening of non-mining economic growth. But hey, don’t take my word for it. Let’s look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge amount of construction has taken place in recent years along with an increase in average salaries. Financing all of this building are commercial loans and also a government backed mortgage program offering the lowest rates in the country. This has led to an explosion of outstanding loans to finance the building of apartments and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I’ve charted outstanding loans and deposits from 2001–2016 (the most recent year available from the national statistical office). After the mining boom in the early 2010’s loans skyrocketed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolians-more-debt/debt-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of outstanding loans is nearly 12.5 trillion MNT (just over 5 billion USD). At the same time deposits have grown significantly, but not at the same pace as loans. Ulaanbaatar leads the country in outstanding loans with 78% of all outstanding loans. These numbers combined with estimates in 2017 that there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://theubpost.mn/2017/02/19/free-up-prices-and-dismantle-monopolies/&quot;&gt;35–40 thousand empty apartments&lt;/a&gt; in Ulaanbaatar are quite concerning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this debt trend national? Below I mapped the total of outstanding loans per capita in 2016 for each province (aimag) using Tableau. I excluded Ulaanbaatar as it highly imbalanced the map. As this is per capita we are balancing each provinces population to better compare them. For comparison Ulaanbaatar had a total outstanding loans per capita of 26.88 million MNT (nearly 11,000 USD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mongolians-more-debt/debt-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty clear debt is consolidated primarily in Ulaanbaatar. This is both good and bad. Nearly half the population and most of the economic activity of the country is in Ulaanbaatar. However this also probably means the average UB’ier has more debt than the average person in the countryside. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mongolian-data-stories/unemployment-in-mongolia-infographic-4595aab9bb85&quot;&gt;youth unemployment over 20%&lt;/a&gt;, debt in the nations capital may prove too much to bear.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Ritz</name></author><category term="debt" /><category term="loans" /><summary type="html">But they are also richer.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/mongolians-more-debt/debt-cover.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mongoliandatastories.com/images/mongolians-more-debt/debt-cover.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
